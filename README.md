Battery_Combining_In_Sillico
========================================================

Battery_Combining_In_Sillico is a repository with all necessary
informations and ressources for generating and analysing the electrodes mesostructures through our data-driven stochastic
 electrode generator algorithm by using Matlab as programming language.

Please, do not hesitate to discover the team of researchers behind the librairy and also the ARTISTIC project
 involved : [ARTISTIC](https://www.u-picardie.fr/erc-artistic/?L=0)


Setup
========================================================
This code uses [Image Processing Toolbox](https://fr.mathworks.com/products/image.html).
We strongly recommand you to get it properly.


Code
========================================================
Format files _.m_ and _.dat_ need to be loacated into the same working
directory.

**Script_Main.m** consists on the principal code to be launched on Matlab.


Example
========================================================
Inside the **./example** folder, you can find a output dataset as example.
It contains eight different electrode formulations.
